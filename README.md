# Intro

I'll be working through the [Odin Project's Etch-A-Sketch exercise](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project).

## What I Did Well

- The javascript is concise and clear. Two functions and a prompt/event listener.
- Looked at the performance of `innerHTML` for the `clearGrid` function and refactored it. It runs much quicker for larger resets.
- Planning before coding. I took the time to think through how I should approach it, which made for far fewer refactors.

## What I Need To Improve On

- Still not great at styling... I purchased a Design Fundamentals course and will work through it. There's some basic design concepting that I just skip and my page looks boring.
- Didn't do the bonus. I'm really excited to get into the backend work, so the optimistic side of me says "I'll come back and do the bonus work".
